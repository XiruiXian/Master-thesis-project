My KTH Master thesis project
1. Download a significant subset of the Physionet dataset.

2. Parse the annotations to a convenient format. This part is a bit tedious but it is essential that the format is robust.

3. Concatenate the recordings per electrode / channel.

4. Build a neural network where the input would be the concatenated channels and the labels the annotations.

5. Train the system.

6. Measure the performance.

7. Letâ€™s try to make some adjustments to increase the performance.
